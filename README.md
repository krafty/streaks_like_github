# streaks_like_github
Just a simple project to display the history of the commits like 
github streaks from TFS. Done in my personal time at home. 
Designed to be extensible... can plug in any source control.

This is not a serious project, just created for fun with Git and visual studio.
Tools used: 

Visual studio 2013 Community Edition (free)

TFS online (https://www.visualstudio.com/)
